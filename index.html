    <br>
    <li class="S">So during summer vacation we all plan something adventurous with friends and family.This time i went to visit a few beaches during hot summer . We had lot of fun in the beach waters , making sand castles . After sometime i just sat on the beach gazing at the sky , the clouds which seems to be moving , it was just so mesmerizing beauty just above our head which we never look at .</li>

<li id="I">I could just see clouds in the form of a huge bird with sharp beak , huge wings in the light blue sky a pure white bird . Just at the little distance was a ship like structure of the cloud . Does'nt it seem like a travelling ship in the light blue sea(actually light blue sky)and the birds above the ship which could see the whole world from the above.</li>
<li id="C">It was such a nice day , such an awesome weather.</li>
